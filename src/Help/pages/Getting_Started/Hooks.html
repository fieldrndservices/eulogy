<h1>Hooks</h1>

<p>A hook is a <abbr title="Virtual Instrument">VI</abbr> that is executed either before (pre) or after (post) a Eulogy-related action, which enable Eulogy users to customize and/or extend the conventions and automations used in the Eulogy add-on and toolkit. Eulogy-related actions include:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Bury</strong> - remove a grave from the target <abbr title="Virtual Instrument">VI</abbr>'s block diagram.</li>
    <li><strong>Dig</strong> - create a grave around a selection of GObjects in a target <abbr title="Virtual Instrument">VI</abbr>'s block diagram.</li>
    <li><strong>Reanimate</strong> - create a zombie from the corpse case in a grave.</li>
    <li><strong>Smite</strong> - disable the corpse case with a zombie in a grave.</li>
</ul>

<p>For each of these actions, a hook <abbr title="Virtual Instrument">VI</abbr> is executed regardless if the action was initated from the Shortcut Menu Plugin (SMP), the Graveyard, Quick Drop Keyboard Shortcut (QDKS) plugin, or toolkit API.</p>

<a name="criteria"></a><p>A hook <abbr title="Virtual Instrument">VI</abbr> must have the appropriate name, connector pane pattern, connected terminals, and be located in a specific location in order to be executed before or after a specific Eulogy-related action. The naming convention is a prefixed "Pre" or "Post" followed by a hyphen, "-", then the action name: "Bury", "Dig", "Reanimate", or "Smite", and ending with the file extension, ".vi". For example, the hook to be executed before a Smite action would be, "Pre-Smite.vi", while a hook to be executed after a Dig action would be, "Post-Dig.vi". Thus, there are the following supported hook names:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Pre-Bury.vi</strong> - executed before a corpse, or zombie, is buried within a target <abbr title="Virtual Instrument">VI</abbr>'s block diagram.</li>
    <li><strong>Post-Bury.vi</strong> - executed after a corpse, or zombie, is buried within a target <abbr title="Virtual Instrument">VI</abbr>'s block diagram.</li>
    <li><strong>Pre-Dig.vi</strong> - executed before a grave is created within a target <abbr title="Virtual Instrument">VI</abbr>'s block diagram.</li>
    <li><strong>Post-Dig.vi</strong> - executed after a grave is created within a target <abbr title="Virtual Instrument">VI</abbr>'s block diagram.</li>
    <li><strong>Pre-Reanimate.vi</strong> - executed before the corpse case within a grave is converted to a zombie within a target <abbr title="Virtual Instrument">VI</abbr>'s block diagram.</li>
    <li><strong>Post-Reanimate.vi</strong> - executed after the corpse case within a grave is converted to a zombie within a target <abbr title="Virtual Instrument">VI</abbr>'s block diagram.</li>
    <li><strong>Pre-Smite.vi</strong> - executed before a zombie within a grave is neutralized within a target <abbr title="Virtual Instrument">VI</abbr>'s block diagram.</li>
    <li><strong>Post-Smite.vi</strong> - executed after a zombie within a grave is neutralized within a target <abbr title="Virtual Instrument">VI</abbr>'s block diagram.</li>
</ul>

<p>When a Eulogy-related action is executed, regardless of origin, the corresponding action will look for a Pre (before) hook <abbr title="Virtual Instrument">VI</abbr>, execute the pre-hook <abbr title="Virtual Instrument">VI</abbr> if found, execute the action, look for a Post (after) hook <abbr title="Virtual Instrument">VI</abbr>, and finally execute the post-hook <abbr title="Virtual Instrument">VI</abbr> if found. The action looks for both the Pre and Post hooks in the following, priority-ordered locations (highest priority listed first):</p>

<ol>
    <li><code>[Application Directory]\Eulogy\Hooks</code></li>
    <li><code>[Application Directory]\.eulogy\Hooks</code></li>
    <li><code>[LabVIEW Data Directory]\Field R&D Services\Eulogy\Hooks</code></li>
    <li><code>[vi.lib]\Field R&D Services\Eulogy\Hooks</code></li>
</ol>

<p>This means that only the hook <abbr title="Virtual Instrument">VI</abbr> at the highest priority location will be executed if it meets the previously mentioned criteria (file name convention, connector pane pattern, and correct connected terminals). Hooks located at lower priority directories will not be executed and ignored.</p>

<p>The recommended process for creating a hook <abbr title="Virtual Instrument">VI</abbr> is to use the <a href="/pages/Add-on/Tools_Menu.html#create-a-hook">Create a Hook...</a> action from Eulogy's <a href="/pages/Add-on/Tools_Menu.html">Tool Menu</a> add-on, but templates VIs for each hook to be copied to the appropriate location and modified to extend Eulogy are located at <code>[vi.lib]\Field R&D Services\Eulogy\Toolkit\Support</code>. The templates contain the "Template" suffix in the file stem. Thus, for each hook, the following template VI exists:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>[vi.lib]\Field R&D Services\Eulogy\Toolkit\Support\Pre-Bury Template.vi</code></li>
    <li><code>[vi.lib]\Field R&D Services\Eulogy\Toolkit\Support\Post-Bury Template.vi</code></li>
    <li><code>[vi.lib]\Field R&D Services\Eulogy\Toolkit\Support\Pre-Dig Template.vi</code></li>
    <li><code>[vi.lib]\Field R&D Services\Eulogy\Toolkit\Support\Post-Dig Template.vi</code></li>
    <li><code>[vi.lib]\Field R&D Services\Eulogy\Toolkit\Support\Pre-Reanimate Template.vi</code></li>
    <li><code>[vi.lib]\Field R&D Services\Eulogy\Toolkit\Support\Post-Reanimate Template.vi</code></li>
    <li><code>[vi.lib]\Field R&D Services\Eulogy\Toolkit\Support\Pre-Smite Template.vi</code></li>
    <li><code>[vi.lib]\Field R&D Services\Eulogy\Toolkit\Support\Post-Smite Template.vi</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Be sure to copy the file and rename it without the "Template" suffix, i.e. the <code>Pre-Bury Template.vi</code> copy should be renamed to <code>Pre-Bury.vi</code>; otherwise, the corresponding action will not find and execute the hook <abbr title="Virtual Instrument">VI</abbr>.</p>
