<p class="Body">The best way to learn Eulogy and become proficient with refactoring legacy code is with usage, practice, and experience. Thus, Eulogy add-on comes with a variety of examples (<strong>Help>>Find Examples...</strong>) that either demonstrate a specific Eulogy concept, or provide practice refactoring code. The following is the recommended order for working through the examples that are shipped and installed with the Eulogy add-on.</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Dig a Grave - Simple.vi</strong>: Demonstrates how to dig a grave around a selection of objects, or nodes, in a block diagram. A grave is the most basic concept, or building block, for Eulogy and refactoring legacy code.</li>
    <li><strong>Reanimate - Simple.vi</strong>: Demonstrates reanimating a corpse into a zombie when the legacy code needs to be executed or used as opposed to the refactored code.</li>
    <li><strong>Smite - Simple.vi</strong>: Demonstrates how to smite a zombie, which enables the refactored code instead of the legacy code.</li>
    <li><strong>Bury - Simple.vi</strong>: Demonstrates removing a grave from a block diagram.</li>
    <li><strong>Graveyard - Simple.vi</strong>: Demonstrates using the custom Bookmark Manager (Graveyard) to manage and monitor graves and zombies.</li>
    <li><strong>Dig a Grave - Complex.vi</strong>: A slightly more complex refactoring task that is good practice for creating and nesting multiple graves in a block diagram.</li>
    <li><strong>Graveyard - Complex.vi</strong>: An example of a refactoring-in-progress that can be used as practice for using all of the actions and concepts of Eulogy.</li>
</ol>

<p class="Body">Note, there are also a series of examples for using the Toolkit API and programmatically completing Eulogy-focused actions. These are considered optional and advanced usage. Since the documentation for the Toolkit API for more information about extending and incorporating Eulogy.</p>
