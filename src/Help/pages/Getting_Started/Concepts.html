<p>Eulogy takes advantage of two features within the G programming language and the LabVIEW development environment: (i) <a href="http://www.ni.com/white-paper/3684/en/">Diagram Disable Structures</a> and (ii) <a href="https://forums.ni.com/t5/LabVIEW-News/5-Things-You-Need-to-Know-About-LabVIEW-Bookmarks/ba-p/3486903">Bookmarks</a>. Diagram Disable Structures have been available in the G programming language since LabVIEW 8, and are akin to comment blocks in text-based code languages. Bookmarks have been available since LabVIEW 2013. In essence, Eulogy is a framework and/or set of conventions for using these two features to refactor legacy code.</p>
<p>The Eulogy framework is based on the concept of a "grave" and the desire to bury, or remove, dead, legacy code from a codebase. A grave is simply a Diagram Disable Structure with a specific format for its label and two frames with formatted subdiagram labels and names. The Diagram Disable Structure label of a grave includes the <code>#RIP</code> bookmark tag, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 timestamp</a> string of when the grave was created, and a user surrounded by parentheses. Within Eulogy, the label for a Diagram Disable Structure that matches this format is known as a &quot;tombstone&quot;, while the timestamp is known as the Time of Death (ToD) and the user is known as the &quot;grave digger&quot;. Next, a grave contains an initially disabled frame that includes the legacy code to eventually be removed, and an initially enabled framed that includes the refactored code to remain after the legacy code is removed. The legacy code frame is known as the &quot;Corpse&quot; and the refactored code frame is known as the &quot;Spirit&quot;. The names of each frame are used for the subdiagram labels of the Diagram Disable Structure. The following image shows the Corpse and Spirit frames of the same example grave:</p>

<p>When a grave is first created, a.k.a. dug, it is also convention to create a copy of the Corpse frame and use it to create the Spirit frame. The Corpse frame serves as a reference that can always be enabled if needed for testing or regression, while starting with a duplicate of the legacy code for the Spirit frame allows to immediately and directly refactor the code. A typical refactoring technique is to create a sub-VI of the legacy code. With Eulogy, a grave would be dug around the legacy code, a copy of the Corpse frame would be used for the Spirit frame, and within the Spirit frame a sub-VI would be created containing the legacy code. This has the added benefit of creating bookmark of the exact location of the modification, or change, and keeps a reference of the original code until the modification has been verified to work without loss of functionality, i.e. regression.</p>

<p>Graves make up the most basic concept and convention of Eulogy, but once a grave exists the inherent features of the Diagram Disable Structure can be used to manage the &quot;state&quot; of the refactoring. There might be times when the refactored code (Spirit frame) is still a broken work-in-progress but the whole VI must be run. In this case, the refactored code should be disabled (Spirit frame) and the legacy code should be enabled (Corpse frame). In other words, the code should be reverted to the legacy state. This would be the equivalent of commenting out the refactored code and un-commenting the legacy code in a text-based code language. In LabVIEW, the Corpse frame is enabled using the shortcut menu of the Diagram Disable Structure, but when a Corpse frame is enabled, there now exists &quot;dead&quot; code that has come back to life, or reanimated. In Eulogy, this is known as a &quot;zombie&quot;, i.e. a corpse that is hopefully only temporarily alive. After enabling the Corpse frame, the Eulogy convention is to replace the &quot;Corpse&quot; subdiagram label with a <code>#Zombie</code> bookmark tag followed by an ISO 8601 timestamp string of when the zombie was reanimated and the user surrounded by parentheses that created the zombie. The timestamp for the zombie is known as the &quot;Rebirthday&quot; and the user is known as the &quot;Necromancer&quot;. The following image shows an example Zombie at a grave:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/Getting_Started/Example_Zombie.png" alt="Example Zombie" border="0"></p>

<p>Once the refactoring is completed and it no longer causes a broken VI, the zombie can be converted back to a corpse, a.k.a. smite. The subdiagram label for the Corpse frame (legacy code), is _not_ changed back to &quot;Corpse&quot;. Instead, the zombie text for the Corpse frame's subdiagram label is left unmodified to keep a log of the last time the legacy code had to be used. The enabled/disabled state of the Corpse frame is used to indicate if the zombie is alive or not.</p>

<p>After the refactored code has been verified to not introduce a regression, bugs, or side-effects through testing, it is time to remove the legacy code for good and only keep the refactored code. The grave is removed from a block diagram by ensuring the Spirit frame is visible and the <strong>Remove Diagram Disable Structure</strong> menu item is executed from the shortcut menu for the Diagram Disable Structure. This will remove the grave and leave behind only the refactored code (Spirit frame). In Eulogy, this is known as burying a corpse, or simply &quot;bury&quot;. Since the legacy code is permanently removed from the block diagram, this is a good time to save a new version of the code within a version control system.</p>

<p>Since the tombstone of a grave and a zombie contain bookmarks, the default <a href="http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/371361K-01/lvdialog/bkmk_manager_moreinfo/">LabVIEW Bookmark Manager</a>, <strong>View>>Bookmark Manager</strong>, can be used to find all graves and zombies in a project or codebase. A programmer can &quot;jump to&quot; any grave or zombie in any VI that is in a project or in memory. This makes navigating and managing a refactoring tasks easier and using only LabVIEW built-in features.</p>

<p>It can be tedious to manually create graves (dig), enable legacy code (reanimate), disable legacy code (smite), and remove graves (bury) using only the built-in menus and actions for Diagram Disable Structures. Creating a grave is especially cumbersome because of steps involved. For example, there is no built-in, quick way of wrapping a selection of block diagram objects/nodes in a Diagram Disable Structure. Also, the LabVIEW Bookmark Manager functionality is a little too generic and limited because all bookmarks are shown and graves cannot be directly manipulated from within the Bookmark Manager. Thus, Eulogy consists of five (5) components that make up the add-on and toolkit for working with graves easier and more efficient:</p>
