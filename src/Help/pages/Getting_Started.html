<p>Eulogy is an add-on and toolkit for refactoring legacy code. It takes advantage of two features within the G programming language and the LabVIEW development environment: (i) <a href="http://www.ni.com/white-paper/3684/en/">Diagram Disable Structures</a> and (ii) <a href="https://forums.ni.com/t5/LabVIEW-News/5-Things-You-Need-to-Know-About-LabVIEW-Bookmarks/ba-p/3486903">Bookmarks</a>. Diagram Disable Structures have been available in the G programming language since LabVIEW 8 and function similarily to comment blocks in text-based code languages. Bookmarks have been available since LabVIEW 2013. In essence, Eulogy is a framework and/or convention for using these two features to refactor legacy code.</p>
<p>The Eulogy framework is based on the concept of a "grave" and the desire to bury, or remove, dead, legacy code from a codebase. A grave is simply a Diagram Disable Structure with a specific format for its label and two frames with special subdiagram labels and names. The Diagram Disable Structure label of a grave includes the <code>#RIP</code> bookmark tag, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 timestamp</a> string of when the grave was created, and a user surrounded by parentheses. Within Eulogy, the label for a Diagram Disable Structure that matches this format is known as a &quot;tombstone&quot;, while the timestamp is known as the Time of Death (ToD) and the user is known as the &quot;grave digger&quot;. Next, a grave contains an initially disabled frame that includes the legacy code to eventually be removed, and an initially enabled framed that includes the refactored code to remain after the legacy code is removed. The legacy code frame is known as the &quot;Corpse&quot; and the refactored code frame is known as the &quot;Spirit&quot;. The names of each frame are used for the subdiagram labels of the Diagram Disable Structure. The following image shows an example grave:</p>

<p>When a grave is first created, a.k.a. dug, it is also convention to create a copy of the Corpse frame and use it to create the Spirit frame. The Corpse frame serves as a reference that can always be enabled if needed for testing or regression, while starting with a duplicate of the legacy code for the Spirit frame allows to immediately and directly refactor the code. A typical refactoring technique is to create a sub-VI of the legacy code. With Eulogy, a grave would be dug around the legacy code, a copy of the Corpse frame would be used for the Spirit frame, and within the Spirit frame a sub-VI would be created containing the legacy code. This has the added benefit of creating bookmark of the exact location of the modification, or change, and keeps a reference of the original code until the modification has been verified to work without loss of functionality, i.e. regression.</p>
<p>Since the tombstone of a grave contains a bookmark, a.k.a. hashtag, the default <a href="http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/371361K-01/lvdialog/bkmk_manager_moreinfo/">LabVIEW Bookmark Manager</a>, <strong>View>>Bookmark Manager</strong>, can be used to find all graves in a project or codebase. A programmer can &quot;jump to&quot; any grave in any VI that is in a project or in memory. This makes navigating and managing a refactoring tasks easier and using only LabVIEW built-in features. However, it can be tedious to manually create graves and the LabVIEW Bookmark Manager functionality is a little too generic (all bookmarks are shown). Thus, Eulogy consists of five (5) components that make up the add-on and toolkit for working with graves easier and more efficient:</p>
